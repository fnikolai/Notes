===== Points =====
* **Points of Failure / Maintenance** : Centralized systems are easy to maintain as there is only a single point of failure. Decentralized have more but still finite. Distributed systems are the most difficult to maintain.
* **Fault Tolerance / Stability** : Centralized can be highly unstable. Kill the leader and there will be chaos. Kill the leader for a decentralized system and you will have many decentralized systems. Distributed systems are very stable and a single failure doesn’t do much harm.
* **Scalability / Max Population** : Centralized — low scalability, Decentralized — Moderate, Distributed — Infinite.
* **Ease of development / Creation** : Centralized systems can be created really fast, you pick up a framework and apply it everywhere. For Decentralized and Distributed, you have to first work out the lower level details like resource sharing (trade) and communications (transport).
* **Evolution / Diversity** : Since centralized systems follow a single framework, they don’t have diversity and evolve slowly. But for Decentralized and Distributed systems, once the basic infrastructure is in place, evolution is tremendous.


===== Usages =====
* If you want to grow fast and scale is not a concern, go for centralized.
* If you are solving a problem of scale and not in hurry, choose distributed. If in hurry, choose decentralized.
* If you have a strong leader, choose centralized. But if you have good managers, then choose decentralized and if you have a lot of individual contributors, then choose distributed.
