====== Blockchain ======
Created Tuesday 24 January 2017

A blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously-growing list of ordered records called blocks. Each block contains a timestamp and a link to a previous block. By design blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data â€” once recorded, the data in a block cannot be altered retroactively.
