====== QIO ======
Created Tuesday 24 January 2017

* I/O operations on these systems are initiated by issuing a QIO call to the kernel. There are two types of QIO - Queue I/O, and Queue I/O and Wait.

=== Queue I/O ===

* the call returns immediately.
* If the request is successfully enqueued, the actual operation occurs asynchronously. 
* On completion, status is returned in the QIO status doubleword.
* The QIO request may also specify that completion set an event flag or issue an Asynchronous System Trap (AST).

=== Queue I/O and Wait ===

* allows synchronous I/O
* In this case, the wait-for-event-flag operation is combined so the call does not return until the I/O operation completes or fails.

===== QIO arguments =====

* The event flag to set when the operation completes. 
* The channel, a small integer previously associated with the device.
* The function code to be performed. 6 bits are assigned to the basic code (such as read, write), with a further 10 bits for "modifiers" whose meaning depend on the basic code.
* The optional I/O status block (IOSB), which is cleared by the QIO call, and filled in on completion of the I/O operation.
* The optional AST routine to invoke when the operation completes.

===== QIO completion =====
There are three different ways to sense when the queued I/O operation has completed:

* When the event flag becomes set.
* When the first two bytes of the IOSB become nonzero.
* When the AST routine executes.
