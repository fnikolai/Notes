==== Analytical  DB (On-line Analytical Processing - OLAP) ====
* analyze data of data warehouses (widely used by Data Mining techniques)
	* aggregated, historical data, stored in multi-dimensional schemas (usually star schema). 
* low volume of transactions, 
* Queries are often very complex and involve aggregations,  response time is an effectiveness measure. 


===== Archive DB =====
