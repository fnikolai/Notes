{{./pasted_image.png?width=400}}

* PAC is used as a hierarchical structure of agents, each consisting of a triad of presentation, abstraction and control parts
* The agents (or triads) communicate with each other only through the control part of each triad. 

=== Components ===
* The abstraction component retrieves and processes the data
* The presentation component formats the visual and audio presentation of data
* the control component handles things such as the flow of control and communication between the other two component
