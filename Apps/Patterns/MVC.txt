* Model–view–controller (MVC) is a software design pattern for implementing user interfaces on computers
* The MVC design pattern decouples these major components allowing for efficient code reuse and parallel development.

* Traditional MVC arranges model (e.g., data structures and storage), view (e.g., user interface), and controller (e.g., business logic) in a triangle, with model, view, and controller as vertices, so that some information flows between the model and views outside of the controller's direct control. 

=== Components ===
* The model is the central component of the pattern. It expresses the application's behavior in terms of the problem domain, independent of the user interface. It directly manages the data, logic and rules of the application.
* A view can be any output representation of information, such as a chart or a diagram. Multiple views of the same information are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants.
* The third part, the controller, accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view.[7]

=== Interactions ===
In addition to dividing the application into three kinds of components, the model–view–controller design defines the interactions between them.[8]

* A model stores data that is retrieved according to commands from the controller and displayed in the view.
* A view generates new output to the user based on changes in the model.
* A controller can send commands to the model to update the model's state (e.g., editing a document). It can also send commands to its associated view to change the view's presentation of the model (e.g., scrolling through a document).


* Controller-View Coupling
	* When you move to MVC on the client, Controllers resemble what we call “code-behind.” 
	* The Controller is highly dependent on the View.
