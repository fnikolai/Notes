* Model–view–adapter (MVA) or mediating-controller MVC

* Allows to change the user interface will not affect data handling and   reorganize data  without changing the user interface. 
* The model–view–adapter solves this rather differently from the model–view–controller by arranging model, adapter or mediating controller and view linearly without any connections whatsoever directly between model and view.


* === Multiple adapters between the same model-view pair ===

* Multiple adapters may be created to change the way one view presents data for a given model. 
* For example, different governments (either among different states of the USA or different nation-states internationally) may impose different codes of law, that in turn impose different business logic for the same underlying database and for the same outwardly presented website. In this scenario, a class of various adapters or mediating controllers can represent the variations in business logic among these jurisdictions in between the same database model and the same website view.
