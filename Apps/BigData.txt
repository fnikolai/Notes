====== BigData ======
Created Monday 23 January 2017

===== 5 V's of Big Data =====
* Volume: Huge amounts of data
* Variety: Different kinds of data
* Velocity: Frequency at which data is generated, captured and shared
* Veracity: Truthfulness and quality of data
* Vale: Benefit of solution for an organization for their big data issues

===== Heterogeneity =====
Both type of heterogeneity force users to stick to a single vendor or a particular type of Cloud or impose heavy expense on porting

==== Vertical ====
* Found within the same type of Clouds
* Caused by the interface and procedural heterogeneity across similar clouds
	* For Example; IaaS providers
* Can be addressed using middleware to homohenize the API and sometimes enforcing standaralizaton

==== Horizontal ====
* Found within different types of cloud
* Caused by the heterogeneity in the paradigm of each cloud type
	* For example, PaaS clouds afollow the philosophy of making the device and platform details transparent to the Cloud user
* High level modeling effort can pay off when one needs to move application and code across different types of cloud

=== High level modeling ===
* Type of semantics
	* Useful for portability and interoperability in Cloud computing
	* Primary means of interacting with a cloud environment is through Web SErvices
* Level of Abstraction
	* An indicator of granularity and specificity of the modeling
	* Ontological modeling is favored at higher level
* Software life cycle
	* Consider each stage of life cycle and avoid conflicts

=== Semantics ===
* System semantics
	* Semantics pertaining to the system characteristics. Deployment and load balancing

* Data semantics
	* Data typing, storage formatting, access and manipulation restrictions

* Non-Functional semantics (QOS characteristics)
	* Performance, security, logging
* Logic and Process
	* Programming language, runtime, exception handling
