Dataflow is deterministic which allows parallelism.
Actors are non-deterministic which allows concurrency.



A flow chart details the processes to follow. A DFD details the flow of data through a system.

In a flow chart, the arrows represent transfer of control (not data) between elements and the elements are instructions or decision (or I/O, etc).

In a DFD, the arrows are actually data transfer between the elements, which are themselves parts of a system.


Both OO and FP are largely single-thread paradigms. 
FBP offers vertical integration, along the "stream", 
wheras MR increases the width of the stream.
