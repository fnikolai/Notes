====== Durability ======
Created Wednesday 26 July 2017

* Transaction being durable means that after you’ve got a reply from DB that the transaction has succeeded, DB guarantees that it will never go back. 
* Kind of flush (sync) operation when you’re writing to file – you may write stuff to the file (or within transaction), but only after you’ve got a ‘successful’ notification from flush() (or from transaction) – you can be sure that it is indeed guaranteed to be written.6
