====== DLM ======
Created Sunday 22 January 2017

* runs in every machine in a cluster, with an identical copy of a cluster-wide lock database.
* synchronize their accesses to shared resources.
* The DLM is used not only for file locking but also for coordination of all disk access.

===== Lock modes =====

=== Null (NL) ===
* Indicates interest in the resource, but does not prevent other processes from locking it. I

=== Concurrent Read (CR) ===
* Indicates a desire to read (but not update) the resource. It allows other processes to read or update the resource, but prevents others from having exclusive access to it.
* Usually employed on high-level resources, in order that more restrictive locks can be obtained on subordinate resources.

=== Concurrent Write ===
* Indicates a desire to read and update the resource.
* Allows other processes to read or update the resource, but prevents others from having exclusive access to it. 
* Employed on high-level resources, in order that more restrictive locks can be obtained on subordinate resources.

=== Protected Read ===
* This is the traditional share lock, which indicates a desire to read the resource but prevents other from updating it. Others can however also read the resource.

=== Protected Write ===
* This is the traditional update lock, which indicates a desire to read and update the resource and prevents others from updating it
* Others with Concurrent Read access can however read the resource.

=== Exclusive ===
* allows read and update access to the resource, and prevents others from having any access to it.

==== Locking ====
* Enqueue lock requests
* Either synchronous or asynchronous (AST occurs when the lock has been obtained)
* Lock value block : the value associated with each resource (e.g version, timestamp, ...)
