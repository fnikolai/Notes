====== BASE ======
Created Wednesday 26 July 2017

* Means: **Basically available, soft state, eventually consistent**


===== Overview =====

* BASE is optimistic and accepts that the database consistency will be in a state of flux.
	* Leads to levels of scalability that cannot be obtained with ACID
	* Support partial failures without total system failure
	* Consistency does not mean Correct, it just meas the consistency of data among many hosts

* If 2PC is not acceptable on the system, an alternative alternative solution is idempotent updates.
	* An operation is considered idempotent if it can be applied one time or multiple times with the same result. 
	* Idempotent operations are useful in that they permit partial failures, as applying them repeatedly does not change the final state of the system.
	Example: a transaction that consists of two decoupled updates 

* To implement idempotent:
	* One technique is to use a table that records the transaction identifier that have been applied
	* Another solution, is every transaction identifier to be used only once , but then a concern is ordering -but can be solved with message queues-
		* If no transaction can be repeated, there is no need for idempotence
