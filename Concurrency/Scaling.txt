====== Scaling ======
Created Wednesday 26 July 2017

* 2PC (two-phase commit) for providing ACID guarantees across multiple database instances.
* The availability of any system is the product of the availability of the components required for operation.

===== Vertical =====


===== Horizontal =====

==== Functional scaling (Normalization) ====
* Involes grouping data by function and spreading functional groups across databases
* Relying on database constraints to ensure consistency across functional groups creates a coupling of the schema to a database deployment strategy
* For constraints to be applied, the tables must reside on a single database server, precluding horizontal scaling as transaction rates grow
* Functionally distinct data on different database servers. This requires moving data constraints out of the database and into the application.
* Consistnecy across functional groups is easier to relax than within functional groups

==== Sharding ====
* Splitting data within functional areas across multiple databases, or sharding,1 adds the second dimension to horizontal scaling.
