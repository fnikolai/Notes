When launching a task, you can create a volume that exists outside the taskâ€™s sandbox and will persist on the node even after the task dies or completes.

Persistent volumes can only be created from reserved disk resources, whether it be statically reserved or dynamically reserved. A dynamically reserved persistent volume also cannot be unreserved without first explicitly destroying the volume. These rules exist to limit accidental mistakes, such as a persistent volume containing sensitive data being offered to other frameworks in the cluster. Similarly, a persistent volume cannot be destroyed if there is an active task that is still using the volume.


Persistent volumes can also be created on isolated and auxiliary disks by reserving multiple disk resources.


By default, a persistent volume cannot be shared between tasks running being managed by different executors: that is, once a task is launched using a persistent volume, that volume will not appear in any resource offers until the task has finished running. Shared volumes are a type of persistent volumes that can be accessed by multiple tasks at the same agent simultaneously; see the documentation on shared volumes for more information.

To use this endpoint, the operator should first ensure that a reservation for the necessary resources has been made on the appropriate agent (e.g., by using the /reserve HTTP endpoint or by configuring a static reservation). The infor
