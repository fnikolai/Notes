====== POSIX ======
Created Monday 25 September 2017

In the area of "requires POSIX filesystem semantics" what is typically meant is:

allows hierarchical file names and resolution (., .., ...)
supports at least close-to-open semantics
umask/unix permissions, 3 filetimes
8bit byte support
supports atomic renames on same filesystem
fsync()/dirfsync() durability gurantee/limitation
supports multi-user protection (resizing file returns 0 bytes not junk)
rename and delete open files (Windows does not do that)
file names supporting all bytes beside '/' and \0
