====== Sirocco ======
Created Wednesday 30 August 2017



While current POSIX-centric file systems for HPC
are geared toward traditional scientific computing workloads,
data analytics applications are becoming a more prominent
consumer of compute cycles on large-scale computers.


. This design is adherent to the Lightweight
File Systemâ€™s [2] philosophy, which uses a minimal storage
system with authentication and authorization. Other services,
such as naming and locking, are separate components.


Another differentiating feature of Sirocco is that it includes
storage interfaces and support that are more advanced than
typical storage systems. For example, Sirocco enables clients
to efficiently use the key-value or bulk storage paradigm with
the same interface. It also provides several levels of transactional
data updates within a single storage command, up
to and including ACID-compliant updates. T
