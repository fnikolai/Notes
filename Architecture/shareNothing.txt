* Shared nothing architecture means the nodes in the system don’t share memory or disk
	* Data resides locally (disk, ram)
	* Accessible through network (TCP, RDMA...)

* Each node own a subset of the data, and operates exclusively on that

* The space of all possible primary keys is partitioned (a.k.a “sharding”) by using either hashing or range based partitioning, such that one or more partitions could be assigned to a primary physical location.

* Since data is spread across several nodes, assuming a uniform key and request distribution, the system scales linearly to multiple nodes. It could be also made elastic by using consistent hashing and/or virtual partitions. For availability and reliability, different types of replication can be used, placing the data at multiple physical locations.

* In case of independent failures, partitioning also provides fault isolation: provided the system knows how to serve results from a partial dataset, only the partitions held by the failed nodes are affected.



===== Queries =====
* send query to the data, parallel execution if possible
* compute: inside queries, as user-defined	 functions
	* To the storage controller-side
* All nodes equal
