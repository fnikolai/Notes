* Any node can access any data directly through a read/write interface
* Contention when numberous nodes attempt to communicate with the disk
* Shared cache on each of the computing nodes to avoid contention
	* Hugh-speed network to maintain cache coherency

===== Queries =====
* Send data to the query, not vice-versa as is happening with share Nothing.
* Compute: user program, disconnected from data storage
	* To the client-side 
* Parallelism: user controlled
* All nodes are not equal
